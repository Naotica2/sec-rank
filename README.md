Yo, this ainâ€™t some JSON code or API, just a script for a SKRIPT Spigot server plugin.

Basically, this script lets players get a free rank just by typing /freerank. Of course, you can customize it to give out whatever rank you want for free.

Feel free to modify or edit the code as long as you know what you're adding.

Peace out!
